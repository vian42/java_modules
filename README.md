# Project about Java modules and strong encapsulation
You have here a simple project about a scooters provider and a client.

Everything seems fine but you will see that the client does something he should not.

## What do I have to do ?
You have to modularize the java way the project and see what you can do to counter what
the client does wrong with your service.

You will also see that reflection is used by client which is normal in this exercise.
See the TODO for that.

The ScooterMain class is just useful for the reflection part.

Beware of what could happen with some dependency after modularization :)
